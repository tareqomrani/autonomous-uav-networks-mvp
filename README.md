# üöÄ Autonomous UAV Networks ‚Äì Digital-Green v2.3  
**Aerospace-Accurate Multi-UAV Communication & Networking Simulator**

---

## üß≠ Overview  
This simulator models multi-UAV networks with integrated aerodynamic, atmospheric, and RF models.  
It is inspired by and aligns with themes from the survey article _‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence-Based Autonomous UAV Networks: A Survey‚Äù_ by Sarkar & Gul (2023) üìñ  [oai_citation:0‚Ä°MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-446X/7/5/322)  
The goal is to operationalize key concepts in autonomous UAV communications, energy modeling, and network security.

The app fuses real-world atmospheric physics (ISA), aerodynamic power models, Two-Ray + Rician propagation, and LTE MCS/MAC layers to explore secure, efficient mission-level UAV networking scenarios.

## üßÆ Core Models & Workflow

1. **Initialization**  
   Randomly generate UAVs (sources, relays, sinks) and (optionally) adversaries (jammer, eavesdropper).  

2. **Atmospheric Computations**  
   Evaluate ISA temperature \(T(h)\), pressure \(p(h)\), and density \(\rho(h)\).  

3. **Aerodynamic Power**  
   Decompose power requirement:  
   \[
     P_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{induced}} + P_{\text{parasite}} + P_{\text{climb}}
   \]
   with standard formulas for each term.

4. **Electrical Power Conversion**  
   \[
     P_{\text{elec}} = \frac{P_{\text{total}}}{\eta_{\text{prop}}\,\eta_{\text{motor}}}
   \]

5. **State Update (Kinematics)**  
   Constrain heading changes, apply wind, climb angle, and update (x, y, h).

6. **Link Budget & Graph Construction**  
   For each transmitter‚Äìreceiver pair, compute path gain (Two-Ray, FSPL) + Rician fading, then SINR ‚Üí capacity.  
   Build directed capacity graph \(G(V, E)\).

7. **MAC Scaling & Flow Computation**  
   Scale link capacities by MAC share factor and run a ‚Äúwidest path‚Äù heuristic (resembling Ford‚ÄìFulkerson) to compute aggregate throughput.

8. **Logging, Visualization & Export**  
   Log per-step metrics, update plots/animations, and provide downloadable outputs.
